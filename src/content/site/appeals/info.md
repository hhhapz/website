## Appealing

If you have been banned from TPH or its sister servers, and would like a second
chance, you can appeal on this page.

<Button to="/appeals/form">New Appeal</Button>

<Button to="/appeals/status">See Status</Button>

### How will I know if I am accepted?

You will be able to visit this page to check the status of your appeal. If your
application is rejected, you may receive a cooldown after which you will be
able to appeal once more. If it is accepted, you will automatically be unbanned
and be able to join the server once more.

### What personal information do I share?

Authorizing with discord only gives us permission to rejoin our servers, and
your basic account info (Discord Username, Tag, and ID).
