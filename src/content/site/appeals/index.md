## Appealing

If you have been banned from TPH or its sister servers, and would like a second
chance, you can appeal on this page.

Please authorize yourself with discord first. This will be used to confirm
your ban status on the server, and to automatically rejoin to the guild.

<OAuthButton>Authorize</OAuthButton>

### How will I know if I am accepted?

You will be able to visit this page to check the status of your appeal. If your
application is rejected, you may receive a cooldown after which you will be
able to appeal once more. If it is accepted, you will automatically be unbanned
and be able to join the server once more.

### What personal information do I share?

Authorizing with discord only gives us permission to rejoin our servers, and
your basic account info (Discord Username, Tag, and ID).
